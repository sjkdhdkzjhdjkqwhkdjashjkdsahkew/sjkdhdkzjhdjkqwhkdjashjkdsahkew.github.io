<div id="tournament"><a href="#tournament"><h3 class="center">Monthly Tournament</h3></a></div><br>
Today we live in a digital age and eSports are now "the thing". This project was purely designed with this in mind.<br>
Sign-ups are always done in the month before the tournament is being played, so if you sign up in April, you will get to play during May.
The tournament style is single elimination blind draw, played 1 versus 1 only for now.<br>
There are 8 players in every bracket, meaning there are up to 7 matches to be played throughout the month.<br>
a match is played every ~4 days. in case of one of the players not showing up, the present one will be advanced automatically; in case of technical difficulties or both players missing, the match will be played during the alternative date assigned to it.

<p>
<h3>Player</h3>
All tournament matches are showcased in each player's profile. There are two leagues:<br>
<br>
<u>Amateur</u> - low fixed entry fee, unlimited number of spots, rather small prizes.<br>
In case of not establishing a full bracket, all up to 7 players get a total refund.<br>
<br>
<u>Professional</u> - high entry fee, very limited number of spots, really big prizes.<br>
The entry fee is based on bidding, starting price increasing for higher divisions (closer to Alpha).
</p>

<p>
<h3>Spectator</h3>
Ticket can be purchased using tokens, if you want to watch with a 5 minutes delay.<br>
All the tournament matches are recorded and accessible for free after a month.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Gambler</h3>
In order to bet on matches from a certain division, you need to not participate as a player, while being a spectator is totally optional. You can bet on matches from the time they're being announced, up to the point they start.

<div id="combat"><a href="#combat"><h3 class="center">Prizes</h3></a></div><br>

they'll get mentioned by commentator before the match<br>
their banner will show up next to the brackets<br>
banner will show up in the player's profile<br>

chance for having product or logo displayed in-game as a unit drop, 34x34 pixels<br>
<br>
there will also be "generic" sponsors, whom banners show up before a match and they also get mentioned by commentator/announcer, percentage goes into prize formula as well as funding the game<br>
email template or web app for sponsorship request (might be in contribute / funding section)<br>
